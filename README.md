# Angular 2 Maps
> Google Maps JavaScript API in the new Angular 2 applications using TypeScript.

## Sample app
The sample application implements Google Maps, Markers, Geolocation and Geocoding.

## Running the sample app
What you need to run the sample app:
* this repository;
* [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org), [Typings](https://github.com/typings/typings) already installed.

In the command line, go to the directory that contains `index.html`:
```
npm install
typings install
```
You need a static server as [lite-server](https://github.com/johnpapa/lite-server):
```
npm install -g lite-server
lite-server
```
and then in a browser visit `localhost:3000/index.html`.
